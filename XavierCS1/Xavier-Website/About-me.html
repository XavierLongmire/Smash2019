		<p><b><div id="para1"> Hello, My name is Xavier Longmire I was born december 28th. In my freetime i enjoy to either watch good t.v shows and/or draw. I own more than 200 drawings from when i was in 6th grade. I mostly like to hang out with my best friends Walter and Alera.

		I recently found some great games and started getting into gaming. My favorite color is red because it represents many thing. Most people say that i'm sarcastic, but i don't see it. Lastly my zodiac sign is a capricorn.	

			I'm mostly proud of my artwork. Back then I couldn’t draw at all. It was like learning how to do it applied to selective people, or like it was kinda impossible for me to learn how to. Most of the drawings I had, I had to redo or throw away because I didn’t like it. I kept going and now i’m able to draw whatever comes to mind. I’m not completely satisfied with my artwork yet because there are many things I still need to learn like coloring or shading with color. I’m still trying to complete my art fully in my view though. It took many years for me to learn to fully draw. Now that I can see all my drawings throughout the years freely. I can deeply say that my art is mines.
